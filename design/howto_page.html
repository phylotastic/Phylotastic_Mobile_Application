<h3>QUICK START<h3> 
<ul>
<li>select list (or "+" to start new)
<li>capture image of name(s)
<ul>
<li>==> names added to list
</ul>
<li>repeat until done
<li>select "Get tree" 
</ul>

<p>LISTS.  To begin, select a list or "+" to start a new one. Captured names go into the active list.  Manage your lists from Home.  </p>

<p>CAPTURES.  We capture text by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition">OCR</a>, then <a href="http://gnrd.globalnames.org/">GNRD</a> finds the biological names.  Other text is ignored, e.g., you can photograph a whole book page to get just 1 name if you want. 

<p>TREES. To get a tree, you have to be viewing a list. Phylogenetic relationships come from the <a href="http://opentreeoflife.org/">OpenTree</a> project. 

<p>IMAGE QUALITY.  Clear obstructions. Hold camera steady, level and perpendicular to the source, 8 to 20 inches away. Activate auto-focus by touching the name.   

<p>TROUBLE-SHOOTING.  Usually OCR is the problem. Reduce blur, double-image, and glare, and avoid low-contrast sources. If all else fails, write the name neatly on your hand and take a photo of that! 

<p>ABOUT.  The <a href="http://www.phylotastic.org">Phylotastic</a> project aims to satisfy the world's hunger for cheap and fast trees.  Please send us your <a href="https://github.com/phylotastic/Phylotastic_Mobile_Application/issues/new">feedback</a>.
