# README: Longwood Gardens signage

This is a collection of 3 photos from a trip to Longwood Gardens, February 27, 2016 (AS).  

Files and directories
* longwood_gardens_signage - directory with 98 images in jpg format
* longwood_gardens_signage.cvs - table with filename, species, quality, quality issues
* longward_gardens_signage_README.md - this file

The images were taken with an iPhone 5 under generally good lighting conditions based on natural light (outdoors or in greenhouses).  
* each photo has a single sign
* each sign has a single species name
* the species names are in italic font
* every sign has white-on-dark text (black or faded black background)
* the actual text size is about 24 points

Nearly all of the images are of high quality for OCR, with clear focus and good contrast.  Some of the images are less than high quality due to 
* blur (out of focus)
* double-image due to camera motion
* non-level tilt of camera
* skewed perspective on sign (above & to the side)
* glare washes out some of the white text
* shadows vary from one part of sign to another
