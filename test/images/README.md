# test images 

Test images are stored in 3 directories: easy, medium and hard.  

Each image is paired with a text file that 
* has the same root name, but with .txt extension
* includes the rows of text shown in the image, one row per line

The suggested categorization is as follows 
* easy - images with text that should be easy to capture by OCR 
   * High contrast between letters and background
   * Plain fonts
   * Sharp focus 
   * Straight focus
* medium - images with one or more modest challenges for OCR
   * actual signage with engraved letters 
   * somewhat out of focus 
   * photographed up to 30 degrees from perpendicular
   * poor contrast 
* hard - images with significant challenges for OCR
   * hand-written names 
   * actual signage with poor contrast 
   * fuzzy image 
   * photographed more than 30 degrees from perpendicular  
   * poor contrast
